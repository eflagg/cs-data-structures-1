Runtime:
1. The number of animal crackers in your box determines your workload.
2. O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n log n), O(n^2), O(2^n)

Stacks and Queues:
1.
	1. stack
	2. queue
	3. stack
2. line at the DMV; HB help queue
3. washing dishes; back button in browser

Linked Lists:
1. Nodes: apple, berry and cherry (including datas of strings "Apple", "Berry", and "Cherry" and next methods for each node); 
head is the apple node (including data and next method); 
there is no tail in this linked list
2. Singly linked lists just have a next method while doubly linked lists have both a next method and a previous method
3. If we can point directly to where the tail is, appending is O(1) whereas otherwise we would have to traverse the whole linked list which would make appending O(n)

Trees:
1. food, Italian, Indian, Mexican, lasagna, pizza, tikka masala, saag, burrito
2. food, Mexican, enchiladas, tacos, burrito, Indian, saag, tikka masala, Italian, pizza, Sicilian, New York-style, Chicago-style
3. A binary search tree can only have 0-2 children (as well as only 1 parent). They also must be balanced, meaning no branch is more than 1 level longer or shorter than another. This way, when searching, you can eliminate half the data at each decision point.
